# ERP Analysis
Codes are available here to perform event-related potential (ERP) analysis. One pipeline is based on Brain Vision Analyzer, and the other is based on EEGLAB. A passive auditory oddball paradigm was used in the data collection, and the result is referred to as emotional mismatch negativity.

## Emotional Mismatch Negativity (eMMN)
Mismatch negativity (MMN) is associated with auditory events when repetitive sounds are interrupted by an occasional oddball sound that differs in frequency or duration. It is attributed to pre-attentive auditory perception changes. MMNs evoked by emotional stimuli are called emotional MMNs, which are characterized by a stronger amplitude with a negative-going deflection.

## Analysis pipeline
- EEGLAB/ERPLAB
  1. run [scripts/ev_export.m](url)
     - import EEG data from Brain Vision Recorder eMMN-sub010.vhdr file
     - export the original event file as eMMN-sub010_ev.csv
    
  2. revise the event file based on the design in the [scripts/evlist.txt](url) and save the updated event file as eMMN-sub010_ev_r.csv
  
  3. run [scripts/ev_import_fr.m](url)
      - import the updated event file into EEG signals and save it as s010.set
      - perform a band-pass filter between 1 and 70 Hz for all channels and save it as s010_f.set
      - re-reference EEG signals to the channels at bilateral mastoids (i.e., TP9 and TP10) and save it as s010_fr.set
    
  4. run [scripts/ica.m](url)
      - perfrom an indepedent component analysis and save it as s010_fric.set
    
  5. if independent component analysis in step 4 can't produce only one significant oculomotor component, try [scripts/ica_pca.m](url) 
      - type "help runica" in the command window for parameters modification at line 37 as needed
    
  6. visually inspect the 2D topography of the independent components and save the 2D map as s010_fric.png
  
  7. remove the component with significant oculomotor activities using "Tools/Remove components" and save it as s010_fro.set
  
  8. run [scripts/eba_erp.m](url)
      - create eventlist in the ERPLAB and save it as s010_froe.set
      - epoch EEG data from 200 ms before to 800 ms after the stimulus
      - correct the post-stimulsu EEG signal based on the pre-stimulus interval and save it as s010_froeb.set
      - reject artifacts using fixed threshold of 100 ÂµV and save it as s010_froeba.set
      - calculate evoked responses based on event codes and save it as s010_froeba.erp
      - calculate the difference between evoked responses based on the typical MMN effect and the reversed MMN effect and re-write it into s010_froeba.erp file
    
  9. Group the individual results by using "ERPLAB/Average across ERPsets (Grand Average)" and save it as Result_all.erp
  
  10. Plot ERPs using "ERPLAB/Plot ERP/Plot ERP waveforms"
